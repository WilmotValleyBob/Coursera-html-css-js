  <h1>Module 4 Solution Starter</h1>
  <p> I am using a WIndows 10 PC. To view the console output from Java Script
  	place your cursor over this text and click.  Then hold CTRL and Shift down
  and hit the "i" key. </p>

  <p> The 10 lines of Hello and Good Bye will be displayed.</p>
  <p> To view the contents of window on the console endter"window" at the prompt in the console.</p>
  <p>Display the contents of window by clicking on the right arrow head just to the left of "Window". Now scroll through the long list looking for "byeSpeaker" and then "helloSpeaker".</p>

  <p> Unfortunately I have no experience as to how the console
  would be opened on a Mac or Linux system</p>
